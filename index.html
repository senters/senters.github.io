Abstract

   Immersive technology, agent-centered event-driven dataflow systems,
   and machine learning have begun to set the stage for "situated
   programming": users composing processes and systems in environments
   that those systems are responsive to.  But in order to integrate
   software meaningfully into the environments of its users, situated
   programming requires a working theory of information, in the sense
   of software meaningfully acting with respect to the content of
   information.  This document introduces senters, a user-level
   protocol supporting an approach to situated programming called
   "narrative process scaffolding" (NPS).  NPS is similar to robotic
   process automation (RPA) in that it applies a user-centered and
   agent-based approach, but differs from it in that it targets
   situated and embodied instrumentation of effects and takes on the
   problem of defining process (including practices of establishing
   information content) narratively.  NPS tests a hypothesis that
   conventions for directing, composing, and sharing processes of
   attending to immediate environments are sufficient to support not
   only basic capacities of software to participate meaningfully in
   activities, but also to participate in the kinds of claim-making
   practices needed for participating in information as content.  The
   senters protocol instruments the cooperative human skill set of
   joint attention with gestures specifying parameters of end-directed
   narrative process.  Human users create and compose narrative flows
   between centers of bearing upon attended-to objectives that are
   supported by artificial proxy agents.  Users are thereby equipped
   to augment their agency with software in engaged situations.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

    <i>"To me programming is more than an important practical art.  It
    is also a gigantic undertaking in the foundations of knowledge,
    and it is certain to add immensely to our understanding of what we
    know and how we know it." --David Sayre in conversation with Grace
    Hopper (1962)</i>

    The development of tools for situated programming could
    potentially boost the expressive power of computing for ordinary
    users, and even ultimately abolish the artificial distinction
    between users and developers for many categories of software
    practice.  A major challenge facing situated programming is that
    we don't yet have working tools and practices that let us hook
    into and meaningfully augment users' involvement/awareness of the
    world, much less do so in composable ways that users can discover
    and create experimentally.  A central thesis of this memo is that
    immersive technologies need to make use of the kinds of ecological
    information that users take advantage of in acting and perceiving.

    The senters protocol (the name is a portmanteau of "sense-making"
    and "center") is proposed to provide a means of grounding
    convention-based information vehicles in actively engaged
    situations.

<b>Empirical and Theoretical Motivations</b>

    Augmenting experience requires software to act on the information
    of the environment/situation a user is embedded in.  This section
    surveys various approaches to information, identifies their
    shortcomings, motivating the choice of usage-based semantics, and
    proposes an approach to applying the usage-based approach to the
    development of situated programming tools.

    <u>Information Processing Approaches to Content</u>

    Claude Shannon's information theory, while not itself a theory of
    information as content but rather a theory of channels and coding
    of information, has been a starting point for some ideas on how
    content could be processed by machines.

    A popular approach to handling information is to collect
    truth-valued assertions about the world, and then use a
    propositional calculus to draw inferences about it.  Fred
    Dretske's 1981 theory of information serves to illustrate, as it
    can be considered representative of computationalist information
    processing approaches to content.  The gist of the theory is that
    a "cognitive" system (meaning a system acting on information
    content) is one that converts analog information into a digital
    representation, and performs manipulations on that digital
    information, allowing it to perform actions targeting properties
    of its environment.  Dretske's notion of information is that data
    indicates or carries information about some property of the world
    if the two vary lawfully enough.

    An unsolved problem for information processing is symbol
    grounding.  The symbol grounding problem is that symbols'
    interpretations are not intrinsic to formal system, but rather
    depend on users of a system to assign their meanings.  Consider
    how any property of the world is encoded as data.  If there is a
    known set of possibilities, then each of the properties
    distinguishing them can be represented as a bit in some data
    structure.  If for some reason it turns out later that different
    properties are needed to indicate the differences between things,
    then the old data will in many cases not be compatible with the
    new data.  There is nothing about the old data or the new data
    that captures the content or meaning of properties of the world,
    but the matching up of differences in data with differences in the
    world allows for behaviors that can align in desired ways.  In
    practice, it is very hard to keep properties of data aligned with
    properties of real environments.

    Another problem is what Hutto & Myin 2013 call "the hard problem
    of content", an argument that information processing theories of
    content such as Dretske's are insufficient to account for how
    information content actually works.  What Dretske calls
    information content is a just a covariance relation, and it can't
    serve as content in and of itself.  The mere existence of data
    varying in tandem with some external property while a useful kind
    of information-sensitivity, lacks negatability-- a defining
    feature of content/propositionality.  Covariance information does
    not itself stake a claim of truth, and thus can't work as content.
    What this means in practice is that it is highly unlikely that
    natural cognition for example operates by passing literal messages
    around to be processed internally by homuncular subcomponents.
    Likewise, aspirations of designing software systems with
    content-aware units that interpret and generate content for other
    modules or for people, have generally been framed in unrealistic
    ways.

    Intractable problems like these suggest that computationalism's
    foundations are shaky, and therefore alternative solutions should
    be considered for the practical challenges of augmenting situated
    experiences.

    <u>Gibsonian Ecological Information</u>

    Gibsonian ecological psychology is a theory of direct perception
    and action that has come to stand out as the most scientifically
    mature program of research in the 4E (embodied, enactive,
    embedded, extended) pragmatic turn in cognitive science.  What
    Gibson found is that agents interact with recurring properties of
    environments called affordances that reliably indicate what the
    results of actions will be.  On the organism side, affordances are
    matched with effectivities or skillful uses of affordances toward
    the ends they afford.  What it means for an organism to perceive
    is to actively adjust itself to an environment.  What is perceived
    is ecological information, a skillful grasp of the nested layout
    of opportunities to control one's self and situation toward
    specific pragmatic ends.

    Ecological information can be picked up directly or indirectly by
    means of conventions.  Convention-based actions are considered
    indirect because they do not engage real-time feedback from lawful
    properties of the world, but rather serve to select or point
    agents to activities of engaging more directly.  Conventions are
    not law-based but more arbitrary, and their efficacy tends to
    depend on a great deal of common ground established through series
    of convention-based coordination of engage activity.  When agents
    are engaged in the same or compatible kinds of direct access to
    the environment (in other words, contexts) different kinds of
    conventions will be effective.

    This approach to information is a qualitative theory of
    information as meaning to agents, and is the sort of account that
    could solve the problems of making meaning accessible to computing
    tools.  Direct ecological information does not suffer a grounding
    problem because it is constituted in lawful relations rather than
    arbitrary mappings.  In turn, convention-based access to
    ecological information serves to point to direct perception, and
    thus is as grounded as the information processes it effectively
    selects.  Assuming a context of immersive media in which direct
    activities can be instrumented with events that users can share,
    the major challenge for making ecological information accessible
    to computing tools is the last mile of linking direct experiences
    of users to practices of calling attention effectively.

    <u>Situation Semantics</u>

    In order to address some of the inadequacies of information
    content theories such as Dretske's, formal logic theorists in the
    1980s and 90s broadened their search for a way to get
    propositional content from natural situations.  Barwise and Perry
    and others developed the situation semantics in an attempt to
    bridge Gibson's theory of ecological information with
    propositional logic.

    Situation semantics was inspired by ecological psychology's
    realist observation that meaning does not reside in the brain nor
    in some mysterious Fregean dimension but in relations between real
    properties of the environment and real properties of organisms.
    The way situation semantics works is by identifying situation
    types, which are generalized from situation instances or events
    called situation tokens.  If there exists a generalized constraint
    between two general types of situations, then that situation's
    token follows from a token of the other situation.  There is much
    more to the situation semantics but this much suffices to show how
    it can be useful.

    Situation semantics seems to have found some niche uses, but there
    are at least two reasons why it does not in itself succeed at
    making the information content of situations accessible to
    computing tools.  The first reason is that by the same argument
    Hutto & Myin applied to Dretske-style information processing,
    basic ecological perception is not content-bearing, and neither is
    situation semantics.  Basic ecological perception is content-free,
    end-directed control, and ecological information is a covariant
    kind of information, not content.  This is very useful information
    of course, it is just not the sort of information that can be
    negated or regarded as claim of truth, and thus can't be treated
    as a proposition without additional setup.  To be clear,
    ecological information via convention-based practices can specify
    content in the kinds of conditions where agents engage in
    claim-making practices using sophisticated public symbol systems
    to scaffold their cooperative engagement.  In the same way, the
    situation semantics could apply here as well, but the situation
    semantics would not be a source or cause of having made
    propositionality work, rather the overtly content-bearing
    practices would be the cause.  For that reason, more attention
    should be given to systematizing processes of social coordination
    that establish the context for making claims.

    The second reason why situation semantics fails to bridge
    propositional logic to natural situations is that it seems to
    misconstrue the nature of convention-based information content
    transfer, developing something not dissimilar from Dretske's
    notion of information. As Hutto and Myin insightfully point out on
    page 64 of Radicalizing Enactivism, information doesn't flow as a
    commodity undergoing transfers and manipulations but as a series
    of events of world-involving vehicles being changed.  Situation
    theory and its logical next step of channel theory regards
    information as packaged in "infons" that undergo manipulations
    such as being merged together into new packages of meaningful
    information.  The problem with proceeding in this way is one
    inherited from formal syntax approaches to information more
    broadly, that is, the notion of expressions carrying information
    independently of being used by agents.  A genuinely computable
    propositional logic will require that social deictic practices
    mediate between the basic covariant information of experience and
    content-bearing expressions.  In order to adequately account for
    information content such that it can be utilized in computing, an
    agent-centered account of coordinating the situated use and
    evaluation of claim-making tools and practices is needed, enabling
    tools to participate effectively in content-bearing practices.

    <u>Usage-based Semantics</u>

    We have so far established that the Gibsonian ecological approach
    fits the bill for the kind of information needed in support of
    augmenting situated activities, but the situation semantics, a
    famous attempt to formally package and process ecological
    information, fails to deliver the kind of information needed.  In
    keeping with ecological psychology research on convention-based
    information, in conjunction with embodied cognitive science
    research on evolutionary origins and ontogenic development of
    human communication, a promising approach to integrating software
    into sense-making practices is usage-based semantics.

    To review what has been established about information thus far:

    * direct perception of ecological information guided by real-time
      interaction with environmental affordances is directly causal,
      lawful covariance information.  It is a basic kind of meaning
      that does not qualify as propositional content.

    * convention-based access to information works by directing an
      agent to selectively attend to a particular direct
      perception/action objective versus some other.  Conventions are
      often effective only given a context of agents already attending
      to one or more other activity.  Scaffolding is a term that
      refers to use of convention to select directly attended-to
      activities.

    * information as <i>content</i> requires more than just
      scaffolding of action/perception generically, it requires
      scaffolding of claim-making practices, by which the efficacy of
      claims are evaluated and claims are refined through use.

    In order to make conventions point to ecological information
    effectively, and then to establish content-bearing practices,
    understanding such practices is in order.  Fortunately, there is a
    relevant and deep literature targeting precisely what is needed
    here.  The usage-based approach to understanding human
    communication finds its pragmatist roots in Vygotsky, Bruner, and
    Wittgenstein, and has been developed to a great deal of empirical
    detail in contemporary experimental psychology and cognitive
    linguistics by Tomasello, Goldberg, and others.  This research
    uncovers the source of the uniquely human ecological niche in a
    cooperative framework of joint attention.

    Primate and human child development research supports a theory
    that communication originated with gesture.  The function of
    gesture is to direct attention.  Human gesture is best understood
    with the assumption that we are bent on cooperation and we seek to
    clearly perceive others' intentions.  We recognize that agents are
    always engaged in active end-directed processes, and as children
    beginning around nine months of age we begin to learn how share
    processes of attending, follow into end-directed processes, and
    direct processes toward ends.  These three ways of intervening in
    others' attending demonstrate the communicative motives of
    sharing, informing, and requesting that are hypothesized to be
    innately evolved in support of cooperative group behaviors.

    Gesture is the first way that humans learn to steer attention
    together, and scaffolding extends the role of gesture in the form
    of tools steering attention in specifically targeted ways. Child
    language acquisition is an example of learning complicated
    scaffolding.  In this process the child must learn that when an
    adult uses a particular kind of construction (a conventional
    pattern or template of language use) he or she selects a process
    of attending to particular objective of meaningful involvement in
    the situation.  Linguistic constructions thereby serve to scaffold
    joint attention in patterned ways.  Constructions in language fit
    into the categories of communicative motives: engaging,
    supporting, and directing processes of attending, and they
    intervene in processes that communicators are mutually aware of
    being engaged in. As an example, around 2-3 years of age children
    begin to pick up on identification and possession constructions
    like "it is X", "that is X", and "that's my X".  Using these
    constructions is to participate in engaged processes, supporting
    them by calling attention to something someone would presumably
    want to know.  Another important fact about such constructions is
    that despite seeming simple they are examples of propositional
    information content achieved by participating in claim-making
    practices.

    <u>Narrative Process Scaffolding</u>

    Having established a theoretical background, a conceptual outline
    of the narrative process scaffolding approach to information for
    situated and embodied computing can now be presented.  NPS is a
    proposed way of integrating ecological information into computing
    by means of deictic gestural conventions.  Two foundational
    observations made are that people continually attend to
    end-directed processes, and that when we engage others, we seek to
    be aware of what they are actively engaged in doing.  NPS supports
    such awareness by explicitly tracking engaged processes,
    specifying them through use of a set of gestures.  Because such
    specifications guide the coordination of attending, they qualify
    as scaffolding.  These processes of scaffolded attending, grounded
    in effective instrumentation of direct ecological involvement,
    make agent-centered ecological information accessible to artificial
    agents.  Proxy agents can augment the activities of human users in
    ways that integrate meaningfully into situations, thus fulfilling
    the requirement that software be able to act on the information of
    the situation a user is embedded in.

    From a user perspective, NPS involves instrumenting concrete
    factors in interacting with the world (via instruments), and using
    instrument events via gestures to develop narrative processes.
    Narrative processes are flows among centers.  Centers are the
    basic units of end-directed narrative process.  Gestures indicate
    the relevance of an instrumented event to a center with respect to
    the three motivating predicaments of engagement, support, and
    realization.  Because each of these motives can be inverted for
    any event (refraining rather than engaging, voicing opposition
    rather than following in support, continuing rather than exiting)
    there are a total of 6 gestures.

    Classifying events bearing on nexuses or centers of end-directed
    process is a way of mapping out avenues of narrative sense-making.
    The paradigm of agents instructing other agents by scaffolding
    attention appears to be a viable solution to the seemingly
    intractable problem of integrating software into the flow of
    meaningful information content in society.

<b>Requirements</b>

    Senters aims to be agnostic to platforms that frameworks and
    libraries adopting it might target.  For that reason there is no
    attempt to guarantee of compatibility between systems implementing
    the protocol.  The protocol only addresses the message format and
    the process of making use of messages logged by agents.  The
    protocol generically requires the existence of a message transport
    system capable of sharing append-only feeds with other users, some
    concept of being able to identify users by an id or key of some
    kind, and some means of sharing references to specific versions of
    code in repositories (for instruments).

    A reference implementation of a personal mobile senters node is
    planned to be built in ClojureScript with React Native, making use
    of the Secure Scuttlebutt protocol, taking advantage of emerging
    web standards for augmented reality, and applying an initially
    naive approach to optimization of proxy-agent scaffolding using
    evolution strategies, described in detail below.

<b>Terminology</b>

    agent

        An agent can refer either to a user or an adaptive software
        process acting on behalf of user.  In cases where both or
        either may apply interchangeably, the term "agent" is applied.
        In cases where a presumed human or otherwise primary agent is
        specifically meant, the term "user" is applied.  In the case
        of a presumed artificial or secondary process extending the
        agency of a user, the term "proxy" is used.

    end-directed process

        End-directed process refers to an agent's process of control
        with respect to an environment's affordance of opportunities
        to effect outcomes.  The term "attending" generically refers
        to any engaged end-directed process of perception/action.

    narrative process

        Narrative process is a kind of end-directed process concerned
        specifically with the selection, composition, and direction of
        decisions to attend.  As such, it is a second-order mode of
        end-directed process that is convention-based rather than
        law-based in its relation to ecological information. (See

    scaffolding

        The use of conventions to specify narrative process.  Through
        successively sophisticated scaffolding, basic agents are made
        more capable.  The flow of information among coordinating
        agents is primarily a gestural process of joint attention,
        which is elaborated by the coordination of scaffolding to
        become more complex modes of communication.  Instruction,
        collaborative exploration, the creation of culture, and the
        organization of personal identity and life narrative, are
        notable examples of the application of scaffolding.

    narrative process scaffolding

        A software approach to integrating situated information
        processes by coordinating agent scaffolding.  (See NPS section
        of theoretical background discussion above.)

    senters

        The protocol for narrative process scaffolding defined in this
        memo.  The name is a portmanteau of "sense-making" and
        "center".

    instrument

        Users "instrument" aspects of situated and embodied experience
        using instruments, concrete programs that might affect and/or
        be sensitive to aspects of the environment.  When a user
        instruments something, typically in the context of a narrative
        process, the instrument emits events, in addition to having
        other possible effects such as visual and auditory displays
        and interactive feedback.

    instrument event

        Events are recorded on feeds, which are immutable append-only
        logs associated with instruments and centers.  Events of
        instruments are recorded on the feed for an agent's instance
        of actively instrumenting.

    gesture event

        Gesture events (as distinct from instrument events) are
        recorded on the feed for an agent's instance of scaffolding
        with a center.  The function of gesture is to relate an
        instrumented environmental feature to a narrative process, so
        instrument events as recorded on the agent's feed for that
        instrumentation are then referenced on the agent's feed for
        the center scaffolding that process in the context of the
        gesture.

        Gestures signal the bearing of events on the narrative process
        scaffolded by a center in one of three ways corresponding to
        the communicative motives identified in research on joint
        attention (See theoretical background section).  These three
        motivating predicaments are engagement, support, and
        realization of process.  Because each of these predicaments
        can be inverted, there are 6 gestures: engage/refrain,
        follow/voice, and continue/exit.

    center

        A center is defined in terms of three sets of events (these
        sets are referred to as the bases of the center) as identified
        by gestures applied to the events in the context of the
        center.  The three bases of a center correspond to the
        distinct concerns of engagement, support, and realization of
        end-directed process.  As explained above, these have been
        identified as the three factors scaffolding narrative
        processes.  To properly visualize this, centers should be
        considered nodes, and their bases (events flagged by gestures)
        should be considered sets of edges to other centers or to
        events.  Centers as nodes are fully constituted by their
        edges, but get their identity only from their exit/realization
        edges.

<b>Overall Operation</b>

    The overall operation of the protocol in its prescribed use can be
    most clearly presented by considering it from the distinct
    perspectives of users, proxies, and instrument developers.

    NOTE: this section is intentionally left underdeveloped at this
    stage of exploring and building out the software.

    <u>User Operation</u>

    Assuming a framework implementing the senters protocol, a user in
    any situation can publish a message on their feed expressing any
    of the following actions:

        * Instrument a situated interaction.  This is assumed to be a
          single application of an instrument to the situation.
          Instrumenting in the context of a narrative process may
          thereby be iterative toward some end.

        * Gesture an instrumented interaction to a center. This can be
          addressed to no one in particular or with a particular
          recipient.  Collaborative narrative scaffolding is conducted
          in this way.  Gestures indicate that events signal options
          to engage/refrain, follow/voice, or continue/exit a center.

        * Provision or stop an agent scaffolded with a center.
          Provisioning agents could also be handled with a system for
          managing the allocation of resources to relevant personal
          interests and needs.  Agents then participate actively in
          the situation.

    <u>Proxy Operation</u>

    An active proxy may take any of the actions listed for users
    above, in the context of being scaffolded by its center.

    Proxies are assumed to learn from feeds of data that source the
    bases of centers.  The protocol is learning-algorithm-agnostic,
    and to avoid introducing unnecessary complexity into the
    discussion, a simple learning method will be assumed: evolution
    strategies with access to data from past experiences.  Optimizing
    for realizing the exit conditions of a center that scaffolds an
    agent is at least at a high level straightforward, given examples
    of processes that led to these conditions, in the form of the
    historical feeds constituting the bases of centers.

    A new proxy agent spawned by the user is scaffolded with a center.
    It is provided access to its referred-to feeds of past narrative
    processes that can be read and converted into topologies of
    incidences of getting from process to process, and conditions that
    held in those paths.  Proxies ideally have access to feeds of from
    many users' past narrative processes.  The process must also be
    granted appropriate capabilities to invoke instruments where
    appropriate.

    <u>Instrument Development</u>

    The protocol is agnostic to how instruments should work other than
    that they can executed a single time and be expected to complete,
    and they should simple, single-purpose, and granular so as to be
    composed in narrative processes.

    Instruments must provide events by recording them on a feed as
    specified in the section on protocol conventions below.
