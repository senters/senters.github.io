      The rapid and disruptive rise of generative AI that has followed
      from the invention of transformer neural networks, has raised
      concerns about how to harness this new and more powerfully
      expressive form of computing, while ensuring successful outcomes
      for humanity as as a whole, The <b>superempowerment
      manifesto</b> makes a long-term case for the steady advance of
      deliberately induced upgrades to the human cognitive niche,
      brought about by advances in intellectronic infrastructure.

      A paper <b>the fabric of society in the fabrication of shared
      context</b> presents a theoretical framework drawing upon
      Gibsonian and Vygotskyan cognitive science and Peircean
      biosemiotics to guide our proposed approach to implementing
      technologies that augment human agency.

      The open source software application <b>senters</b> is an
      exocortical framework expanding the reach of personal and social
      agency by leveraging generative AI to augment attentional
      actions.  It aims to pave a long-term path to superempowment of
      individuals and their networks by growing a rich cognitive
      computing ecosystem rooted in human-level attention
      infrastructure.

      The handbook <b>minding an ecology of steps: toward a practice
      of attention-flow computing</b> presents a pragmatic and
      grounded vision of how senters can be used in the near term and
      over the long-term to progressively move closer to the goal of
      widespread superempowerment.
