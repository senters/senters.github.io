    <h2>Coming Soon</h2>
    <p>
      The rapid and disruptive rise of generative AI that has followed
      from the invention of transformer neural networks has raised
      concerns about how to harness this powerfully expressive way of
      computing, while ensuring that humanity maintains awareness and
      control of systems vital to survival.  <b>Superempowerment</b>
      is a position paper making a case for long-term incremental
      decentralized development of upgrades to the human cognitive
      niche, brought about by advances in intellectronic
      infrastructure.  By primarily focusing resources into augmenting
      human agency and intelligence, we can ensure that technological
      development continues to function as an extension of the telos
      of biological life and human biocultural evolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another document, <b>The Fabric of Society in the Fabrication of
      Shared Context</b>, presents a theoretical framework drawing
      upon Gibsonian and Vygotskyan cognitive science and Peircean
      biosemiotics to guide our proposed approach to implementing
      technologies that augment human agency.
    </p>
    <p>
      The open-source tool <b>Senters</b> is an exocortical framework
      expanding the reach of personal and social agency by leveraging
      generative AI to augment attentional actions. It is presented as
      a viable first step toward paving a long-term path to
      superempowerment of individuals and their networks by growing a
      rich cognitive computing ecosystem rooted in human-level
      attention infrastructure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The handbook <b>Minding an Ecology of Steps: Toward a Practice
      of Attention-Flow Computing</b> presents a pragmatic and
      grounded vision of how Senters can be used in the near term and
      over the long-term to progressively move closer to the goal of
      widespread superempowerment.
